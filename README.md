# Excel Spreadsheets Management

A set of Python scripts to manage your Excel spreadsheets.

NOTE: For all of these programmes, you will need `Openpyxl` (a Python library that provides various methods to interact with Excel Files). Since this module does not come in-built with Python, you will need to run `pip install openpyxl`.
